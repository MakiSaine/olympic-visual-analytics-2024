## Explanatory Text

Tableau was used to import, clean, and merge datasets for analysis.  
Unnecessary columns were removed and renamed for clarity. For example:  
- “City” → **Olympic City**  
- “Region” → **Country**  

Date fields were reformatted to *year-to-date*, and numerical data types were applied to *Age*, *Height*, and *Weight*.  
Geographic roles were assigned to *Country* and *Olympic City* to enable accurate mapping and visualization.


Below is a visual overview of the data cleaning and preparation workflow.

The combined dataset enabled an interactive dashboard that explores participation, medal distribution, and athlete performance across all Olympic Games between 1896 and 2016.  
It was designed for analysts, historians, coaches, athletes, policymakers, and the general public — anyone interested in understanding Norwegian sports achievements through a data-driven lens.

## Design Explanation

The design emphasizes storytelling through consistent use of color, annotation, and interactivity.  
The visualization types include line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons, and bubble charts for individual achievements.

According to **Kirk (2019)**, line charts improve perceptual accuracy by representing quantitative values through proportional line size and position.  
This allows both detailed analysis and quick comprehension of temporal trends.

Bubble charts visualize individual medals, and bar charts compare results among nations — differentiated by color for gender and medal type.  
The deliberate use of **gold, silver, and bronze** aligns the story visually and semantically, enhancing clarity and engagement.

> “When it comes to explanatory analysis and leveraging visuals to share information, thoughtful use of color and text helps focus the story.”  
> — Knaflic, 2015, *Storytelling with Data*

Interactivity was integrated through hover tooltips and annotations to guide user attention toward key findings.  
These design choices make the presentation both educational and engaging.
